### Issue Brief
Two species face extinction through illegal fishing in the Gulf of California. Poachers target totoaba (<i>Totoaba macdonaldi</i>), a schooling croaker, for the species's swim bladder, a unique product dried and sold in China for prices up to 40,000 USD for a swim bladder weighing in at 370g. Gillnets deployed to catch schooling totoaba have cut populations of vaquita (<i>Phocoena sinus</i>), a small porpoise, from hundreds of individuals in 2000 to fewer than 30 since 2016. Despite intensive effort by nonprofit, national, and international organizations to protect wild populations and cut supply chains to East Asia, the extraordinary prestige value of totoaba swim bladders - 'gold coin maw,' in one of several Chinese trade names - has sustained poaching in the gulf. 

Both the scale of this illegal fishery and the resilience of the target species are captured by spatial data. INAPESCA, the federal fisheries service in Mexico, reports observations of totoaba by fishers and field biologists from 2010 forward. Mexico's SEMAR, CONAPESCA, PROFEPA, the United States FWS and CBP, Hong Kong's AFCD, and the nonprofit Sea Shepherd have reported interdictions of totoaba products. The Environmental Investigation Agency, a nonprofit, compiled interdiction reports and maintains records for public reference and use.

While most interdictions occur at federal checkpoints on highways in Baja California, no high-level spatial trends support changes to enforcement strategies. Anecdotes suggest maw smugglers share methods with other organizations, notably regional drug cartels, leaving flows of processed totoaba maw out of reach for enforcement authorities. 

These data support ongoing work toward management evaluations by a Master's thesis project group in the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Further information is available at the group's
